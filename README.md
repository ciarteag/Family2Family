## Overview

### Description
Connects families that are in need of groceries and toiletries with potential donors. The application allows families to create a shopping list of items available in local stores and place this list as an order. Donors can use the application to check these orders and help families through donations. We will handle the delivery of goods to families. In future we also plan to offer shopping the products for a reasonable additional charge.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Charity, Social Impact, Food & Drink
- **Mobile:** This app is primarily developed for mobile platforms. We plan to develop a web version in the future, which will allow users other functionalities, such as team up to fulfill certain orders (i.e., two donors divide the expenditures of helping a family).
- **Story:** Our application will allow families to place an order of groceries and toiletries so that potential donors can review what they need, and hopefully help them.  
- **Market:** Many times, people have the desire to help others. However, a lack of trust in whether families are in need stops them from doing so. This app aims to solve this problem, providing a safe platform for donors to help families in real need, and for families in need to ask for help safely. 
- **Habit:** This app can be used as often as a family or a donor desire. However, the app will keep track of how many times in a week, a family has requested help, and whether or not they received that help. This information will be publicly available for donors to make an informed choice about what family they would like to support. Donors' activity will be tracked as well (i.e., support score, donor award, etc.). However, this information will be only public if the donor agrees with it.
- **Scope:** Or elemental plan is to generate profit out of the delivery of products. Once a donor confirms to support a family, they will have to specify a pick-up date and provide a meeting point (i.e., their home or one of our pick up points). We will use this information to pick up the order from the donor and deliver it to the families. 

Our future vision is allowing donors to pay for an order online. In this plan, we will not only take care of the delivery but also select the products from the store. We plan to become partners of small grocery stores and local farms that do not count on delivery service.
